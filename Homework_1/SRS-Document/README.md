## SRS Document

## 1. Introduction

The goal of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is to describe and document agreements between the client and the system developer regarding the specifications of the required product. The main purpose of this document is to provide a clear and descriptive overview of user requirements, so that later it can be used as a reference for further development of the software system. This specification of the software requirements will describe the functional and non-functional requirements of the software system.

## 2. Description

Skopje, as the capital and largest city of our country, is a major attraction and tourist magnet for many tourists from around the world. It abounds in a number of tourist attractions (monuments, museums), as well as a number of cafes and restaurants recognizable by our rich cuisine. So, our goal is to make it easier for tourists who would like to rent a car to find a "Rent a Car". Given that every year Skopje is full of a huge number of tourists, we decided to design and create a so-called Skopje Guide in the form of a web application that will be of great help to tourists to manage and find the most recognizable places in our city. This application will be available under the name "Skopje Guide" and in addition to Macedonian will be available in English for foreign tourists. It can be accessed from all web browsers Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari etc.
